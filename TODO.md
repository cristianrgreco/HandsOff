Features

- Instead of touch free streak, have a graph/chart? Somehow comparing it to previous values?
- Option to start at login, auto-start monitoring?

UI/UX improvements

- Better sound than chime? Perhaps AI can generate a custom one?
- Remove monitoring time? Doesn't seem valuable.
- Make bounding box same color as system accent color?

- Sensitivity should just be hardcoded to low I think, why should it not be as accurate as possible?
- Cooldown also just hardcoded to 1s for now I think. If the alert is annoying then what are we doing here?

Bugs

- Face bounding box isn't quite right on x-axis. It s offset a bit too much to the left.
