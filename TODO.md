# Features

- 

# UI/UX improvements

- Update agents: if changing behaviour, offer to build and run so the user can verify the behaviour.

# Bugs

- On first launch, if user does not provide camera permission before stall detector then they get alerted.
- Loop when switching camera.
- Why build and run sometimes exits -600 (launchservices?)

# Testing

- Confirm login items works as expected, if we had or hadn't previously started monitoring.
