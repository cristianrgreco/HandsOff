UI/UX improvements

- Remove monitoring time? Doesn't seem valuable.
- Instead of many beeps, just start and hold one beep, and stop when user stops touching?
- Blur background red, or some other configurable color? Atm the white is a bit too strong in dark mode.
- Sensitivity should just be hardcoded to low I think, why should it not be as accurate as possible?
- Cooldown also just hardcoded to 1s for now I think. If the alert is annoying then what are we doing here?
- Confirm/adjust settings defaults
- Group settings a bit better?

Bugs

- Face bounding box isn't quite right on x-axis. It s offset a bit too much to the left.

Not possible?

- Keep menu bar item open when clicking 'Start monitoring'?

Testing

- Confirm login items works as expected, if we had or hadn't previously started monitoring.
- Confirm what happens if webcam is disconnected while or while not running.
